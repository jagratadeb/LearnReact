# 35 Days of Learning React

A focused, hands-on 35-day curriculum to learn React from basics to advanced topics. Each day includes a short objective, suggested exercises/projects, and recommended resources. Work through one day at a time, build small examples, and commit frequently.

## How to use this plan

- Work daily or at your own pace — one day is designed to be completed in ~1–2 hours of focused work.
- Each day lists a goal, a short exercise, and optional deeper challenges.
- Keep a Git branch or directory per day (e.g., `day-01`) to track progress and snapshots.
- Recommended tooling: Node.js (LTS), npm or yarn, VS Code, and the React Developer Tools extension.

## Quick setup

1. Install Node.js LTS: https://nodejs.org/
2. Create a starter project when you reach Day 2 (Create React App / Vite).
3. Use `git` to track your progress. Commit each day's work.

## Notes

- This plan is flexible — reorder days based on your needs (for example, jump to TypeScript earlier if required).
- Small projects help cement learning. Aim to build and refactor.

Happy learning! If you'd like, I can also:

- Generate a one-file starter template for Day 2 (Vite or CRA).
- Create daily folder scaffolds (`day-01`, `day-02`, ...).
- Convert the plan into a checklist or GitHub Actions workflow to track progress.
